### Context
Visier maintains public release notes in their embedded documentation. The primary audience is users (often technical or admin users) who want to see what new features, fixes, or enhancements have been introduced in recent product releases. The page is organized by years and seasons (e.g. Summer, Winter) and links to more detailed notes for each period.
### Problem
Publishing release notes keeps users informed of changes, helps them adopt new features, reduces support requests, and builds trust by clearly documenting updates over time.
### Contribution
I helped make the release notes clearer and more user-focused by writing feature descriptions to explain not just what changed, but why it matters. To improve usability, I added links from key items to related documentation, allowing users to find details quickly without extra searching.

### Impact
The release notes are now easier to scan and more relevant to each audience. Developers can quickly find updates that affect their work, reducing confusion and support requests. The polished, consistent format also builds trust in the documentation and makes future updates simpler to maintain.
