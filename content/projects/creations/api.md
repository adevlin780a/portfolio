### Context
The ActiveState Platform API lets developers automate runtime builds, manage projects, and integrate directly with the platformâ€™s backend. When I joined the documentation effort, the existing material was minimal and highly technical, which made it difficult for new users to get started.
### Problem
The main challenge was clarity. Developers often struggled with authentication, query syntax, and understanding how REST and GraphQL requests fit together. There were also gaps in examples users could see endpoints, but not how to apply them in real-world workflows.
### Contribution
I reorganized the documentation around user goals rather than system components. I rewrote sections to explain concepts like authentication and API tokens in plain language, and added example requests and responses to show practical use cases.

I also worked closely with developers to verify endpoint details, clarify data models, and make sure the documentation matched current API behavior. This led to the creation of a automatically generated API reference page where developers could quickly find and leverage existing APIs.

### Impact
After the update, the API docs became easier to navigate and more actionable. Users could successfully authenticate and make their first API calls without needing internal support. The new structure also reduced confusion between REST and GraphQL endpoints, helping developers integrate with the platform more confidently and efficiently.
