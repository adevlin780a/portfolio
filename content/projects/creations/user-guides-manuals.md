### Context
As a technical writer at ActiveState, I was tasked with creating a clear and concise guide to help developers quickly set up and start using the ActiveState Platform. This guide serves as an introductory resource for users new to the platform.
### Problem
New users often face challenges in understanding how to begin using the ActiveState Platform, leading to confusion and potential disengagement. Things like creating an account and building a runtime were common friction points for new users. And interacting with the command line interface of the State Tool was not clearly described during onboarding. There was a need for a straightforward, step-by-step guide to facilitate a smooth onboarding experience.
### Contribution
I developed a structured guide that outlines the essential steps for getting started with the ActiveState Platform. Each section is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear instructions and links to additional resources for further assistance. A troubleshooting section was added, comprised of the most common problems users encountered according to a poll done by our support team. 

I also contributed to creating a brief onbaording video, collaborating with members of the Product and Engineering teams to draft and record a script outlining the onboarding process.

### Impact
The guide has significantly improved the onboarding experience for new users, providing them with the necessary tools and knowledge to get started with the ActiveState Platform efficiently. Feedback indicates a reduction in support queries related to initial setup, suggesting that users find the guide helpful and easy to follow.
