I’m a technical writer who loves turning complex ideas into clear, easy-to-follow documentation. My goal is to create content that not only helps users get things done but also makes software and processes feel approachable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked on everything from API documentation and user guides to knowledge base articles, release notes, and internal process docs. I enjoy organizing information in a way that’s intuitive, applying style guides thoughtfully, and collaborating closely with developers, product managers, and designers to make sure everything is accurate and easy to understand.

I’m comfortable with tools like Markdown, HTML/CSS, Adobe FrameMaker, MadCap Flare, Confluence, and Git/GitHub, and I like using diagrams, flowcharts, and annotated screenshots to make content more engaging and digestible.

I’m detail-oriented and organized, and I take pride in turning complex concepts into simple, actionable guidance. I thrive in collaborative environments and love seeing how clear documentation can improve the user experience and support a product’s success.

I’m always excited to work on projects where I can make a real difference through thoughtful, high-quality documentation, helping teams bridge the gap between technology and the people who use it.
